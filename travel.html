        <h2>Berlin</h2>
        <p>In January 2019 I went to Berlin as part of the UCC Entrepreneur and Social Societies Winter Break Tour. 100 UCC students went to Berlin for the weekend with the majority of the group not knowing where we were going until we were on the bus up to Dublin Airport.</p>
