                    <p>The Blockchain is a digital record of transactions. The name 'Blockchain' comes from it's structure, in which individual records, called blocks, are linked together in single list, called a chain. Blockchains are used for recording transactions made with cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, and have many other applications. Every transaction added to a blockchain has to be validated by multiple computers on the internet. These systems forma peer-to-peer network and are configures to monitor specific types of blockchain transactions. They validate each transation before adding it to the blockchain.</p>
                    <p>When a block is added to a blockchain, it is linked to the previous block using a cryptographic hash generated from the contents of the previous block. This ensures that the chain is never broken and that each block is permanently recorded. This also intentionally makes it more difficult to alter past transactions in the blockchain since the subsequent block must be altered first.</p>

                <p>Autonomous things is an emerging term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction, freely moving and interacting with humans and other objects.
                Self-navigating drones are the first autonomous technology to be deployed. The Autonomous car more commonly referred to as a 'self-driving' car is expected to be the first mass-deployed, expected to be available in 2020.</p> 
                <h4><u>The Autonomous Car</u></h4>
                    <p>The autonomous car both addresses the main existing safety issues and creates new issues. It is expected to be much safer than existing vehicles, by eliminating the single most dangerous element â€“ the driver. The US's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 94 percent of US accidents were the result of human error and poor decision-making, including speeding and impaired driving.   So while safety standards like the ISO 26262 specify the required safety, there is still a burden on the industry to demonstrate acceptable safety. </p>

                <p>An immersive experience is an illusory environment that completely surrounds you such that you feel that you are inside it and part of it. The term is associated with technology environments that command the senses such as virtual reality and augmented reality.</p>
                <h4><u>Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</u></h4>
                <p>Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual feedback. Current VR technology most commonly uses virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments, sometimes in combination with physical environments or props, to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to "look around" the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items.</p>
                <p>Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real-world are "augmented" by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual and auditory.Augmented reality systems may also be considered a form of VR that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset or through a smartphone or tablet device giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images</p>
