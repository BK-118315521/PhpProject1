                <h2><b><u>Blockchain</u></b></h2><img src='blockchain.png' alt='Blockchain' style='float: right; width: 350 px; height: 400px'>
                    <p>The Blockchain is a digital record of transactions. The name 'Blockchain' comes from it's structure, in which individual records, called blocks, are linked together in single list, called a chain. Blockchains are used for recording transactions made with cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, and have many other applications. Every transaction added to a blockchain has to be validated by multiple computers on the internet. These systems forma peer-to-peer network and are configures to monitor specific types of blockchain transactions. They validate each transation before adding it to the blockchain.</p>
                    <p>When a block is added to a blockchain, it is linked to the previous block using a cryptographic hash generated from the contents of the previous block. This ensures that the chain is never broken and that each block is permanently recorded. This also intentionally makes it more difficult to alter past transactions in the blockchain since the subsequent block must be altered first.</p>
                <h4><u>Uses of the Blockchain</u></h4>
                    <p>While blockchain is widely known for its use in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ether, the technology has several other uses. For example, it enables "smart contracts," which execute when certain conditions are met. This provides an automated escrow system for transactions between two parties. Blockchain can potentially be used to allow individuals to pay each other without a central clearing point, which is required for ACH and wire transfers. It has potential to greatly increase the efficiency of stock trading by allowing transactions to settle almost instantly instead of requiring three or more days for each transaction to clear. </p>
                    <p>Blockchain technology can also be used for non-financial purposes. For example, the InterPlanetary File System (IFPS) uses blockchain to decentralize file storage by linking files together over the Internet. Some digital signature platforms now use blockchain to record signatures and verify documents have been digitally signed. Blockchain can even be used to protect intellectual property by linking the distribution of content to the original source.</p>

                <h2><b><u>Autonomous Things</u></b></h2><img src='autonomous.jpg' alt='Autonomous' style='float: left; width: 200 px; height: 350px'><br/>
                <p>Autonomous things is an emerging term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction, freely moving and interacting with humans and other objects.</p> 
                <p>Self-navigating drones are the first autonomous technology to be deployed. The Autonomous car more commonly referred to as a 'self-driving' car is expected to be the first mass-deployed, expected to be available in 2020. </p>
                <h4><u>The Autonomous Car</u></h4>
                    <p>The autonomous car both addresses the main existing safety issues and creates new issues. It is expected to be much safer than existing vehicles, by eliminating the single most dangerous element â€“ the driver. The US's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 94 percent of US accidents were the result of human error and poor decision-making, including speeding and impaired driving, and the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School claims that "Some ninety percent of motor vehicle crashes are caused at least in part by human error". So while safety standards like the ISO 26262 specify the required safety, there is still a burden on the industry to demonstrate acceptable safety. </p>
